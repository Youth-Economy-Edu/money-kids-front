# ERROR FIXING PROCESS (Simplified)
1. Define the symptom: Clearly describe the observed issue or error log-
2. Scope impact: Identify related files, components, or data flows.
3. Find root cause: Narrow down the main cause based on code/logic.
4. One-line summary: Explain the issue simply for any developer.
5. Fix points: List code locations to change and why.
6. Code fix: Show the changes and brief explanations.
7. Follow-up: Suggest refactoring, tests, or logging to prevent recurrence.
